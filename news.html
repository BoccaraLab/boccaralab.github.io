									<h3><a href="#">New lab recruit : Welcome to Damien!</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
								Welcome to Damien, our new postdoctoral researcher, who comes from France. His aim is to understand how sleep affects adipose tissue physiology and to investigate the physiological process of adipose tissue post-natal development. He did his PhD at the Clermont Auvergne University, in France, working on the different pathways involved in the differentiation of the adrenal cortex, one of the key organs of the stress response. Before that, he worked on the effects of dietary restriction on the ageing of visceral adipose tissue at the University of Newcastle in the UK.
